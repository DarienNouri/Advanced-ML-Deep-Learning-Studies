    "# Automated Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the use of AutoFeat for automated feature engineering and selection on a regression dataset. It includes interpretability discussions, feature selection, model training, and evaluation before and after feature engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The key steps involve interpreting model explainability, feature selection, model training, and evaluating the impact of generated features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Procedure\n",
    "- **Interpretability and Model Explainability**: Discuss the necessity of model interpretability.\n",
    "- **Feature Selection**: Use `FeatureSelector` on the Diabetes dataset to determine the number of discarded features.\n",
    "- **Feature Engineering with AutoFeat**: Apply `AutoFeatRegressor` to generate new features and assess the relative change in R2 score."
